# Food and Water
In CrystallEdge, your characters have [color=yellow]no hunger or thirst[/color].
If you don't drink or eat, you won't suffer any negative effects.

However, you can eat and drink to gain long-lasting beneficial bonuses.

## Nutrition

Eating enables your character's [color=yellow]passive health regeneration[/color].
This regeneration bonus is [color=yellow]doubled[/color] if you overeat, but at the cost of [color=yellow]slowing you down[/color]: it's physically difficult to move with an overfilled belly.

Be careful: excessive gluttony can lead to negative consequences... even irreversible ones.

## Drinks

Drinks [color=yellow]increase your maximum stamina capacity[/color].
This bonus is [color=yellow]doubled[/color] if you drink enough, but as with nutrition, it will [color=yellow]slow your character[/color].

Excessive drinking can also lead to negative consequences...

# Cooking

Cooked food not only satisfies hunger, but also provides additional bonuses.
Usually, they give a special effect called [color=yellow]“Pleasant Aftertaste”[/color], which further increases health regeneration, but the effects may vary from dish to dish.
The strength and duration of these effects depend on [color=yellow]the complexity of the recipe[/color] — more complex dishes bring greater bonuses!

The cooking process is very simple.
Currently, you can cook [color=yellow]dishes[/color] and [color=yellow]soups[/color] using a frying pan or a cooking pot respectively.

To cook a dish, put the required ingredients inside and place the pan or pot on the heat.
Keep an eye on the cooking process, and don't forget to take it off in time,
otherwise your dish or soup will turn into burnt mush.
