# Food and Water
In CrystallEdge, your characters have [color=yellow]no hunger or thirst[/color].
If you don't drink or eat, you won't suffer any negative effects.

However, you can eat and drink to gain long-lasting beneficial bonuses.

## Nutrition

Eating enables your character's [color=yellow]passive health regeneration[/color].
This regeneration bonus is [color=yellow]doubled[/color] if you overeat, but at the cost of [color=yellow]slowing you down[/color]: it's physically difficult to move with an overfilled belly.

Be careful: excessive gluttony can lead to negative consequences... even irreversible ones.

## Drinks

Drinks [color=yellow]increase your maximum stamina capacity[/color].
This bonus is [color=yellow]doubled[/color] if you drink enough, but as with nutrition, it will [color=yellow]slow your character[/color].

Excessive drinking can also lead to negative consequences...

# Cooking

At the moment, there's no difference between eating raw ingredients and cooked meals,
but in the future cooked food will provide additional bonuses beyond the basic effects of satiety.

The cooking process is very simple.
Currently, you can cook [color=yellow]dishes[/color] and [color=yellow]soups[/color] using a frying pan or a cooking pot respectively.

	<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CECookingPot"/>
</Box>

To cook a dish, put the required ingredients inside and place the pan or pot on the heat.
Keep an eye on the cooking process, and don't forget to take it off in time,
otherwise your dish or soup will turn into burnt mush.
