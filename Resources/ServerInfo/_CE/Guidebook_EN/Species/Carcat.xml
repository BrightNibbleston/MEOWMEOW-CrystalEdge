## Gameplay Features
- Carcats are naturally equipped with sharp claws that deal increased melee damage.
- Wearing shoes? Not for them. Where have you seen boots that would fit paws with claws?
- Soft Paws - soft pads provide absolutely silent footsteps.
- Night Vision - nature has gifted carcats with excellent night vision — they see in the dark almost as well as in daylight.
- Cat-like Grace - carcats can jump from a height of 2 floors without taking any damage or being stunned.
